<h1>javac - The Java Compiler</h1>
<blockquote>
<b>javac</b> compiles Java programs.
</blockquote>


<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
<pre>
   javac [ <a href="javac.html#Options">options</a> ] filename.java ...
   javac_g [ <a href="javac.html#Options">options</a> ] filename.java ...
</pre>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<blockquote>
The <b>javac</b> command compiles Java source code into Java bytecodes.
You then use the Java interpreter - the <a href="java.html"><b>java</b></a>
command - to interprete the Java bytecodes.
<p>
Java source code must be contained in files whose filenames end with the
<code>.java</code> extension.
The file name must be constructed from the class name,
as <i>classname</i><code>.java</code>,

if the class is public or is referenced from another source file.

<p>
For every class defined in each source file compiled by <b>javac</b>,
the compiler stores the resulting bytecodes in a <em>class file</em>
with a name of the form <i>classname</i><code>.class</code>.
Unless you specify the <b>-d</b> option, the compiler places each class file
in the same directory as the corresponding source file.
<p>
When the compiler must refer to your own classes you need to specify their 
location.
Use the <b>-classpath</b> option or <b>CLASSPATH</b> environment variable to 
do this.
The class path is a sequence of directories (or zip files) which
<b>javac</b> searches for classes not already defined in any of the
files specified directly as command arguments.
The compiler looks in the class path for both a source file and a class file,
recompiling the source (and regenerating the class file) if it is newer.

<p>
Set the property <code>javac.pipe.output</code> to <code>true</code> to send 
output messages to <code>System.out</code>. Set <code>javac.pipe.output</code> 
to <code>false</code>, that is, do not set it, to send output messages to 
<code>System.err</code>.
<p>
<b>javac_g</b> is a non-optimized version of <b>javac</b> suitable for
use with debuggers like <a href=jdb.html><b>jdb</b></a> for debugging 
<b>javac</b> itself.  Using <b>javac_g</b> is <em>not</em> equivalent 
to using the command <tt>javac&nbsp;-g</tt>.

<a name=Options>

<h2>OPTIONS</h2>
</a>

<blockquote>

<dl>
<dt><b>-classpath</b><i> path</i>
<dd>
Specifies the path <b>javac</b> uses to look up classes needed to run
<b>javac</b> or being referenced by other classes you are
compiling. Overrides the default or the <b>CLASSPATH</b> environment
variable if it is set.  Directories are separated by semi-colons.  It
is often useful for the directory containing the source files to be on
the class path.  You should always include the system classes at the
end of the path.  For example:

<pre>
   javac -classpath .;C:\users\dac\classes;C:\tools\java\classes ...
</pre>

<p>
<dt><b>-d</b><i> directory</i>
<dd>
Specifies the root directory of the class file hierarchy. In other
words, this is essentially a destination directory for your compiled
classes.  For example, doing:
<pre>
   javac -d C:\users\dac\classes MyProgram.java
</pre>
causes the class files for the classes in the
<code>MyProgram.java</code> source file to be saved in the directory
<code>C:\users\dac\classes</code>. If your class is in the package 
<tt>demos\awt</tt>, the class files would be placed in directory 
<tt>C:\users\dac\classes\demos\awt</tt>.

<p>
Note that the <b>-d</b> and <b>-classpath</b> options have independent
effects.  The compiler reads only from the class path, and writes only
to the destination directory.
It is often useful for the destination directory to be on the class path.
If the <b>-d</b> option is not specified, the source files should be
stored in a directory hierarchy which reflects the package structure,
so that the resulting class files can be easily located.
<p>
<dt><b>-encoding</b><i> encoding name</i>
<dd>

Specify the source file encoding name, such as <code>EUCJIS\SJIS</code>. If 
this option is not specified, then the platform default converter is used.
<p>
<dt><b>-g</b>
<dd>
Enables generation of debugging tables. Debugging tables contain 
information about line numbers and local variables - information used
by Java debugging tools. By default, only line numbers are generated, unless
optimization (<b>-O</b>) is turned on.
<p>

<dt><b>-deprecation</b>
<dd>
    Generate a warning for every use or override of a deprecated member or
    class.  A member or class is deprecated if its documentation comment
    contains the <code>@deprecated</code> tag.  The compiler will emit a
    warning at the end of compilation whether or not <b>-deprecation</b>
    is used; this option causes the location of each individual use or
    override to be noted.
<p>
    Deprecated members or classes are deliberately not mentioned if the
    source file containing the deprecation is being recompiled.  This can
    happen because the file is on the command line or because
    <b>-depend</b> is used and the source file was out of date. 
<p>


<dt><b>-nowarn</b>
<dd>
Turns off warnings. If used the compiler does not print out any warnings.
<p>
<dt><b>-O</b>
<dd>
    Directs the compiler to try to generate faster code by inlining
    static, final and private methods.  This option may slow down
    compilation, make larger class files, and/or make it difficult to
    debug.  <b>-O</b> implicitly turns on <b>-depend</b> and turns 
    off <b>-g</b>.
<p>
    This option informs the compiler that all generated class files are
    guaranteed to be delivered and upgraded as a unit, enabling
    optimizations that may otherwise break binary compatibility.  Use this
    option with discretion.
<p>
    The Java Language Specification section 13.4.21 describes situations
    in which it is legal to use a java compiler to inline methods. The
    compiler will only optimize code for which source is available during
    the compilation, so the only .java files discoverable by the compiler
    should be for classes intended to be delivered or upgraded as a unit.
    In particular, ensure that no sources for other classes are accessible
    on CLASSPATH, keeping in mind that the present working directory, `.',
    is appended to CLASSPATH.
<p>
    To ensure that a product is able to run on 1.1 as well as future
    binary-compatible java virtual machines, one must ensure that any
    sources for JDK 1.1 classes are <i>never</i> available along CLASSPATH
    while using <b>-O</b>.
<p>
<dt><b>-verbose</b>
<dd>
Causes the compiler and linker to print out messages about what source 
files are being compiled and what class files are being loaded.
<p>
<dt><b>-depend</b>
<dd>
Causes recompilation of class files on which
the source files given as command line arguments recursively depend.
Without this option, only files that are directly depended on and
missing or out-of-date will be recompiled.  Recompilation does not
extend to missing or out-of-date files only depended on by already
up-to-date class files.
<p>
<dt><b>-J</b><i>javaoption</i>
<dd>
Passes through the string <i>javaoption</i> as a single argument to the
Java interpreter which runs the compiler.  The argument should not
contain spaces.  Multiple argument words must all begin with the prefix
<b>-J</b>, which is stripped.  This is useful for adjusting the
compiler's execution environment or memory usage.

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>
<blockquote>


<h3>Compiling One or More Classes</h3>
In this example, the source files are located at 
<code>c:\jdk\src\java\awt\*.java</code>. 
Change to the directory holding the class or classes you want to compile.  
Then run javac, supplying one or more class names.
<pre>
  % cd c:\jdk\src\java\awt
  % javac Button.java Canvas.java
</pre>
Compiles the two classes.
</blockquote>

<h2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</h2>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><b>CLASSPATH</b>
<dd>
Used to provide the system a path to user-defined classes. Directories are
separated by semi-colons, for example,
<pre>
   .;C:\users\dac\classes;C:\tools\java\classes
</pre>
</dl>
