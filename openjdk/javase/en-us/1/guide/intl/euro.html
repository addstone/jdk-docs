      <h1>Euro Support</h1>
<blockquote>
This release includes support for the new European Union currency, 
<a href="http://europa.eu.int/euro/">the euro</a>. In order for the JDK software's support for the 
euro character 
to function properly, you may need to install euro-support patches for 
your operating system.  For Windows&nbsp;NT and Windows&nbsp;95, you can 
obtain the required patches from the 
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/euro.asp">Microsoft euro support 
web page</a>. No patch is required for Windows&nbsp;98.  
<p>
Euro-support patches are also required if you are using versions of 
Solaris prior to Solaris&nbsp;7.  
See the <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/install-solaris-patches.html">Solaris patches web page</a> for information on the Solaris patches 
required for euro support.
<p>
The addition of euro support will not affect existing code, except for
character conversion code that relies on changed encodings. No APIs
were changed.

</blockquote>

<h3>Encodings and Euro Support</h3>
<blockquote>
The following encodings have been modified to support the euro currency
character. Code point 0x88 was modified on Cp1251, code point 0x80 on
all the other encodings. These code points were previously unused.
<blockquote>
<table cellborder=0 cellspacing=3>
<tr><td>Cp874</td><td>Windows Thai</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cp1250</td><td>Windows Eastern European</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cp1251</td><td>Windows Cyrillic</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cp1252</td><td>Windows Latin-1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cp1253</td><td>Windows Greek</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cp1254</td><td>Windows Turkish</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cp1255</td><td>Windows Hebrew</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cp1256</td><td>Windows Arabic</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cp1257</td><td>Windows Baltic</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cp1258</td><td>Windows Vietnamese</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
There are also 12 new encodings. Of special interest is ISO8859_15.
This encoding supports ISO&nbsp;8859-15, a character set standard not yet
approved. ISO&nbsp;8859-15 is ISO&nbsp;8859-1 with various changes, including
accented French and Finish characters and the euro currency symbol. 
ISO&nbsp;8859-15 is also known as Latin&nbsp;9, Latin&nbsp;0, and IBM&nbsp;923.
<p>
Before JDK&nbsp;1.1.7, the default encoding under Microsoft Windows for 
Western European locales was ISO8859_1. Starting with JDK&nbsp;1.1.7, the 
default encoding for Western European Locales under Microsoft Windows 
has been changed to Cp1252. Cp1252 does not implement a reversible 
byte/character translation. It may appear to some programmers that this 
introduces an incompatibility. The real problem is a programming 
technique that unintentionally relies on the features of specific 
locales.
<p>
For more information, see the list of <a href="encoding.doc.html">Supported 
Encodings</a>.

<h3>Locales and Euro Support</h3>
<blockquote>
No existing locale resources have been modified for the euro. Instead,
new variant locale resources are provided for each country adopting the
euro. Previously, there were no Luxembourg locale resources. In this
release, Luxembourg gets both base and euro variant locales.
<p>
For more information, see the list of 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1/docs/guide/intl/locale.doc.html">Supported Locales</a>.
<p>
Since the Java&nbsp;1.1 platform specification is frozen, no API was added
to find the euro variant of a non-euro locale. The following example
code locates the euro variant of a non-euro locale. This example
assumes that only the locale resources provided with the Java 
Development Kit are available. A more general solution would be much 
more complicated. 
<blockquote><pre>
if (source.getVariant().indexOf("EURO") >= 0)
    newLocale = source;
else
    newLocale = new Locale(source.getLanguage(),
        source.getCountry(),
	source.getVariant().length() > 0 ?
	    (source.getVariant() + "_EURO") :
	    "EURO");
</pre></blockquote>
